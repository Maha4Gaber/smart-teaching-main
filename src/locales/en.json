  "GSMGTDetails": "The quality of an education system cannot exceed the quality of its teachers. (McKinsey, 2007).<br><br>All the evidence from different education systems around the world shows that the most important factor in determining how well children do is the quality of teachers and teaching.“What is the most important school related factor in student learning? The answer is teaching” said Professor Bob Schwartz (Harvard GSE, 2010).<br><br>There is a consensus that improving teaching quality is one of the most direct and promising strategies for improving education outcomes. Every aspect of school reform depends on highly skilled teachers for its success.",

  "teachingStrategiesInfo2": "John Hattie, one of the foremost experts on effective teaching, has amassed a database of research on the classroom factors and teaching methods that improve student learning, and quantifying the effect they have. Hattie compiled 800 meta-analyses of more than 52,000 studies of 240 million students to rank the effectiveness of different teaching practices. Hattie distils his research into a simple proposition for teachers – “know the impact”.",
  "teachingStrategiesInfo3": "Hattie studied six areas that contribute to learning: the student, the home, the school, the curricula, the teacher, and teaching and learning approaches. Hattie developed a way of ranking various influences in different meta-analyses related to learning and achievement according to their effect sizes. He ranked 138 influences that are related to learning outcomes. Hattie found that the average effect size of all the interventions he studied was 0.40. Therefore he decided to judge the success of influences relative to this ‘hinge point’, in order to find an answer to the question “What works best in education?”",
